# Q/A

# Describes key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today? 

# ANS
The internet back in the 1980's was considered as a mere experiment for communication purposes amongst employees highly sophisticated organisations such as the ARMY / scientists. 
It was never thought that the internet would one day be available for mass public to use/communicate with the entire world. 

From a mere means of communication amongst employees of an organisation to approx 5 Billion people living on the earth today, thats how the internet has evolved from the 1980's to today. 
Speed and sophistication also followed. 

# Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers ? 

# ANS 
Domains : Domains are basically the english( readable to human ) translation of IP addresses. ex: github.com which will have about 10 digits long IP address difficult to remember. 

Web Servers : These are basically softwares written or hardware used to fulfill client's request. it generally processes network requests via HTTPS. some example are apache, Nginx

DNS: stands for domain name systems. basically like yellow pages for domain names. an address book or phonebook of all IP's or domains. 

Web Browsers: In laymans language, these are softwares that convert computer language to readable language that we as humans can understand and interpret. ex google chrome, IE, mozilla. web browsers receive info from web servers in HTTPS format and convert them to human readable format. 

# Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today?

# ANS

Due to development and ease and reach of internet usage, it has made connectivity a lot easier amongst humans all around the globe. 

Compared to times where pigeons and eagles were used as a method of communication, today's internet has made instant messaging , video calls, audio calls all over the world as the fastest means of communication.

Sharing live feeds, information, expressing oneself in front of the whole world as audience has only been made possible due to development and advancement in internet technologies.
